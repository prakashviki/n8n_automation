# 🧠 Daily Productivity Tracker (n8n + Sheets + Telegram)

I used to end my days thinking:

> “I was busy… but did I actually move forward?”

That question led me to build this **automated daily tracker** using **n8n**, **Google Sheets**, and a touch of **AI** magic.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does

This automation helps you **analyze how you spend every 15 minutes** of your day — automatically.

1. **Quarter-hour tracking**  
   Every 15 minutes, n8n checks your Google Sheet for time blocks.

2. **Smart categorization**  
   Each entry is labeled as:

   - ✅ **Productive** (deep work, client tasks, progress work)
   - 🌀 **Wasted** (scrolling, random clicks, distractions)
   - 🤔 **Unknown** (missing or vague entries)

3. **End-of-day summary**  
   At night, n8n sends a **clean Telegram report** — no fluff, just facts.  
   It highlights where your time went and what needs improvement.
